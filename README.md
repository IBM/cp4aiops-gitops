# IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps GitOps

This repository contains Helm charts intended for GitOps-driven deployment of IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps using Argo CD.

## Usage

The repository maintains dedicated branches and corresponding release artifacts for each version of IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps.

Production adoption of the Helm charts can begin by either forking the upstream repository or extracting the packaged release chart archive for self-hosted deployment via GitOps. Once deployed, customize the chart’s directory structure, particularly the values.yaml, templates directory to align with your target environment’s infrastructure, CI/CD workflows, and runtime configurations.
